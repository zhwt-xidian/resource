He received the B.S. degree (with distinction) in Electronic and Information Engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an 710071, China, in 2006. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees both in Control Science and Engineering, from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Since 2011, he has joined the School of Electronic Engineering of Xidian University, where he is Lecturer from 2011 to 2015. Since August 2015, he was promoted as an Associate Professor. He received the M.S. student supervisor qualification in August, 2016. His research interests include blind signal processing, machine learning, wireless communication, and hardware implementations of digital signal processing systems. In recent years, he also extended his research interests to the applications of blind processing technique to target detection, fault diagnosis and medical signal analysis. His recent research activities can be categorized into two broad topics: I) weak signal analysis and fault detection based on blind signal processing technique and deep learning; II) tensor factorization and its applications to blind deconvolution with considerable reverberation, machine learning, and MIMO-OFDM communications. He is the author or co-author of one textbook and more than 40 articles in journals and conference proceedings. As principal investigator, he hosts and/or participates in some projects including NSFC project, fundamental research program of Shaanxi Province, and joint projects with companies. Dr. Zhang was elected as Young Science and Technology Star of Shaanxi Province in 2017. RESEARCHRESEARCH INTERESTS Dr. Zhang focuses on both theoretical research and system development of signal processing machine learning and wireless communications. The detailed research topics include blind source separation, blind deconvolution, blind channel identification and equalization, deep neural network and its applications, fault detection and diagnosis.
